## 👋 Hi, I'm riskMechanic

I'm currently building my foundation in financial modeling, company valuation, and risk analysis. I come from a background of academic exploration and hands-on curiosity—recently completing a market analysis and a deep dive into financial statements. These projects helped me connect theory to practice and sparked a real interest in how businesses create and measure value.

 What I'm working on:
- Expanding my portfolio with real-world financial analyses
- Applying valuation techniques to small businesses (through ADB frameworks)
- Learning to interpret financial data with clarity and precision

 What you'll find here:
- My first financial statement and market analyses
- Projects inspired by academic finance and structured learning
- Clean, well-documented repositories with transparent methodology

 Currently studying:
- Financial statement interpretation and balance sheet analysis
- Fundamentals of valuation and forecasting
- Investment strategy and Excel-based modeling

🛠️ Tools:
Python · Excel · Notion · C++ · SQL · Power BI
